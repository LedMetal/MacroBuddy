## Description
Have you ever tried coming up with a diet plan that works for you? How many of them showed you results, or how many did you stick with long enough to see them? Do you know what three nutrient bases make up your macronutrients, and how much of each you should be eating?

Well, *MacroBuddy* is here to alleviate you from all the calculations and formulae you'll need to go through to figure out your macronutrients! *MacroBuddy* is your one-stop location to get all your personalized macronutrition information to get you prepared and on your way to meal prepping like the pros! All it takes is some basic information and *MacroBuddy* will send you on your way!

## Development
### Client-Side
*MacroBuddy* utilizes various web development languages and frameworks to present an interactive and data rich website. These technologies include *HTML*, *JavaScript*, *AngularJS*, *jQuery*, *ChartJS*, *CSS*, and *Bootstrap*.

### Server-Side
*MacroBuddy* is live on the author's personal domain, hosted by [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/). When a user successfully calculates his/her macronutrient information, the data gets saved on a database on the server. This is to keep their data saved for when *MacroBuddy - Mobile* is released. In order to communicate with the *MySQL* databases, the connection is made through *PHP*.

## Vision
It is intended to create a mobile application for *MacroBUddy*, in which users can calculate and access their profiles with all calculated data from anywhere. Furthermore, a new workout tracking system is in development, where a user can keep track of every workout, whether it be cardiovascular or weightlifting.
